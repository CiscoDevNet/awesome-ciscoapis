- Add one resource per Pull Request.
- Search existing resources before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Enforce this formatting : * [resource-name](http://link-to-your-resource-depot.com/) - A short description ends with a period.
- Keep descriptions clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Add a section if needed 
   - Needs bibliotica 3 (minimum required) to create a new section
   - Add the section description.
   - Add the section title to Table of Contents.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

In case of doubt, we'll leave it to the community to decide if the resource should be added, by placing votes on the Pull Request. 
10+ votes will make the resource automatically added.  


## Quality standard

To be on the list, github repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Cisco API programmers
- Actively maintained 
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented (README, comments, samples etc.)
- Tests, where practical


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. 

We realize sometimes projects fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. 

We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). 

This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.


Thanks everyone!
